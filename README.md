# Big Brother Is Watching You! [◉°]



This script takes random screenshots during a work session. It can be especially helpful for staying
focused, maintaining productivity, or even writing your thesis.

### How it works
- A form of **self-surveillance**: Use it to monitor your workflow and identify breaks or procrastination
   periods.
- **Mutual productivity feedback**: Share your screenshots with a colleague for accountability and feedback.
  Together, you can review your sessions and encourage each other to stay on track!

### Requrements

To run this script you need:

1. **ImageMagick** - for capturing and processing screenshots.
2. Xorg Display Server or other alternatives – Wayland is currently unsupported due to its security model.

### Usage

Run the script with the desired session duration (in hours).
Example:

```
  
Here, 2.5 indicates a session duration of 2.5 hours.
